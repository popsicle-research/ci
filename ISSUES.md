# CI/CD Platform Development Plan

Below is a breakdown of the development tasks for a minimal CI/CD platform. Each task is defined as a sequential issue with a clear goal, implementation guidance, and acceptance criteria. The issues are written for an AI agent implementer, with architecture considerations and definitions of done (including updating the `architecture.md` as changes are introduced).
